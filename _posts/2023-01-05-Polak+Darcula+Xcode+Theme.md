Before I started my journey with iOS/Swift I was a Java, then Android developer, so AppCode was my natural choice as my main IDE for iOS apps development. However, last month I read something that killed something in my heart:

_With the release of v2022.3, we are sunsetting the product. As of December 14, 2022, we will no longer sell new subscriptions or renew existing ones for AppCode. All active subscriptions will get a fallback license to v2022.3._ [[source]](https://blog.jetbrains.com/appcode/2022/12/appcode-2022-3-release-and-end-of-sales-and-support/)

A total switch to [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) will be a pain for me, at least for the current stage of this IDE. Anyway, to make this switch less painful I decided to make Xcode look a little bit like my lovely Darcula theme in AppCode.

[Here](https://github.com/polok/XcodePolakTheme) are instructions on how you can take it and modify it as much as you want.

Enjoy!
