My name is Marcin Polak. I&#8217;m a software engineer living and working in Gliwice, Poland. 
In my day job I use Java. Currently I&#8217;m fascinated by the Android development. This blog is for me. If others find it useful, cool&#8230;. But, at the end, this will be place where I post things so I don&#8217;t have to remember them:)
